# Code-Samples
Samples of code, such as code snippets and scripts, from projects I've worked on, and possibly new reworked versions of them in the future.
__Reworked versions will be marked explicitly as such.__

- I don't own the projects these code samples belong to.
- The solutions here are not secret and constitute only small portions of the projects they are from, so I'm sure no one will mind if you take some ideas from what I have here.
  - My code may well have been reworked or replaced after I left these projects; these are last versions I made myself.

#### __NOTE: Comments in the code may be changed; the rest of the code remains as it was in the non-reworked samples and scripts.__
